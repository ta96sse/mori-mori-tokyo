# Mori‑Mori TOKYO

This repository contains the source for the official **Mori‑Mori TOKYO** website.

The site is currently a placeholder while the team prepares their full content. It uses Tailwind CSS via CDN and is entirely static.

## Structure

- `index.html` – main entry point for the site.
- `robots.txt` – allow all crawlers.
- `sitemap.xml` – simple sitemap listing the root page.

## Deployment

The site is designed to be hosted with GitHub Pages. Once the repository is pushed to GitHub and Pages is enabled on the `main` branch (root), the site will be available at `https://mori-mori.tokyo/` after DNS records are configured.
